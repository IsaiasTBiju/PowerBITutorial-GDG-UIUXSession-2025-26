__Microsoft Fabric:__
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Fabric Introduction: Released in 2023, Microsoft Fabric is a cloud-based analytics solution designed to streamline data movement, storage, and analysis. It integrates existing tools and introduces new ones to provide a unified toolset for enterprise users.</li>
  <li>Fabric Logo and Interface Changes: When you start Power BI, you'll notice a Fabric logo, indicating that you're working within the Fabric environment. The Power BI icon in the lower left-hand corner now has additional options.</li>
  <li>Terminology Update: In the Fabric environment, what were previously called "datasets" in Power BI are now referred to as "Semantic Models" due to the different meaning of "dataset" in Fabric.</li>
  <li>Performance Enhancements: Fabric's Direct Lake capability allows direct access to enterprise data, improving performance for large reports and complex dashboards. Data improvements made by data scientists and engineers are immediately available to users without needing to reconnect to data sources.</li>
  <li>Centralized Data Governance: Fabric provides centralized data governance and security management, meaning security settings are applied once and don't need to be reset in Power BI. This centralized approach aims to reduce costs and increase competitive advantage.</li>
  <li>Unified Environment: Fabric creates a single environment shared by data professionals and business users, allowing modifications made by data professionals to be immediately available to end-users without separate load events.</li>
</ul>

__KAHOOT Q3, Q4, Q5__ <br>
__PowerBI as data sources__

<ul>
  <li>Semantic Models: In Power BI, datasets are now referred to as semantic models, although the terminology isn't consistent throughout the application.</li>
  <li>Data Sources: You can load data from various sources, including existing semantic models, apps containing reports, and manually entered data. For larger datasets, it's best to avoid manual entry.</li>
  <li>PBIX Files: You can upload PBIX files, which include reports and data, into your workspace.</li>
  <li>Power BI Desktop: For other data sources, such as Microsoft Excel, you need to use Power BI Desktop, which will be explored later in the course.</li>
</ul>

    <ul>
      <li>With the gauge selected, go to the Fields pane.</li>
      <li>Drag the desired data field (e.g., This Year Sales) into the Value well of the gauge visualization.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Set the Goal (Target Value):
    <ul>
      <li>Drag the goal data field (e.g., This Year Sales Goal) into the Target value well.</li>
      <li>If the gauge does not display as expected, ensure the goal is in the correct well.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adjust the Maximum Value: If necessary, move the goal data field to the Maximum value well to set the maximum value for the gauge.</li>
  <li>Format the Gauge:
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the Format pane and expand the Gauge axis section.</li>
      <li>Change the Target color to your preferred color (e.g., brick red).</li>
      <li>Ensure the goal is correctly placed in the Target value well for the color change to take effect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Interact with the Gauge:
    <ul>
      <li>Select different territories or data points to see the gauge update dynamically.</li>
      <li>The gauge will reflect the selected data, showing performance against the goal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Further Formatting:
    <ul>
      <li>Use the formatting tools to adjust titles, colors, and other visual elements to meet your design requirements.</li>
      <li>Ensure consistency in colors and styles across your visualizations for a cohesive look.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Select the table visualization.</li>
      <li>Click on the Slicer icon in the visualization gallery (left of the table icon).</li>
      <li>The table will convert to a slicer with checkboxes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use the Slicer:
    <ul>
      <li>Select items in the slicer to filter data (e.g., select Ohio to filter data for Ohio).</li>
      <li>Hold Control to multi-select items (e.g., Maryland, Ohio, and Tennessee).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Change Slicer Display:
