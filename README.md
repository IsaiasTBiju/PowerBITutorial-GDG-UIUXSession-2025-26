__Microsoft Fabric:__
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Fabric Introduction: Released in 2023, Microsoft Fabric is a cloud-based analytics solution designed to streamline data movement, storage, and analysis. It integrates existing tools and introduces new ones to provide a unified toolset for enterprise users.</li>
  <li>Fabric Logo and Interface Changes: When you start Power BI, you'll notice a Fabric logo, indicating that you're working within the Fabric environment. The Power BI icon in the lower left-hand corner now has additional options.</li>
  <li>Terminology Update: In the Fabric environment, what were previously called "datasets" in Power BI are now referred to as "Semantic Models" due to the different meaning of "dataset" in Fabric.</li>
  <li>Performance Enhancements: Fabric's Direct Lake capability allows direct access to enterprise data, improving performance for large reports and complex dashboards. Data improvements made by data scientists and engineers are immediately available to users without needing to reconnect to data sources.</li>
  <li>Centralized Data Governance: Fabric provides centralized data governance and security management, meaning security settings are applied once and don't need to be reset in Power BI. This centralized approach aims to reduce costs and increase competitive advantage.</li>
  <li>Unified Environment: Fabric creates a single environment shared by data professionals and business users, allowing modifications made by data professionals to be immediately available to end-users without separate load events.</li>
</ul>
